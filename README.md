# üñ•Ô∏è Operating System Programs ‚Äì C Language

This repository contains a collection of Operating System (OS) programs implemented in C. These programs cover core OS concepts such as CPU scheduling, memory management, process synchronization, and deadlock avoidance algorithms ‚Äî typically studied in the 3rd or 4th semester of Computer Science & Engineering courses.
